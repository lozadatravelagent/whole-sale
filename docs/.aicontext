# AI Context - Documentation Guide

This file helps AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) understand and navigate the documentation structure.

## Documentation Organization

All project documentation is organized in `/docs` with the following structure:

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Main documentation index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                         # External API integrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/                # System design & performance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guides/                      # User-facing documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ business-rules/              # Business logic & permissions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/              # Setup & migration guides
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/                     # Historical/resolved issues
```

## Context Loading Strategy

### When asked about USER MANAGEMENT or PERMISSIONS:
- Load: `docs/business-rules/USER_MANAGEMENT_BUSINESS_RULES.md`
- Load: `docs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Reference role hierarchy: OWNER > SUPERADMIN > ADMIN > SELLER

### When asked about API INTEGRATION or TRAVEL SEARCHES:
- Load: `docs/api/Softur - API GUIDE.md`
- Load: `docs/architecture/ASYNC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md`
- Check EUROVIPS/SOFTUR workflows
- Reference: `docs/api/examples/` for real API responses

### When asked about PDF GENERATION or CUSTOMIZATION:
- Load: `docs/guides/CUSTOM_PDF_TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md`
- Load: `docs/guides/BACKGROUND_IMAGE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`

### When asked about PERFORMANCE or OPTIMIZATION:
- Load: `docs/architecture/ASYNC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md`
- Load: `docs/architecture/RATE_LIMITING_SUMMARY.md`
- Check async search implementation

## Quick Reference Map

| User Query Topic | Primary Docs | Secondary Docs |

| "pdf template" | guides/CUSTOM_PDF_TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md | guides/BACKGROUND_IMAGE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md |
| "slow searches" | architecture/ASYNC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md | architecture/RATE_LIMITING_SUMMARY.md |
| "permissions error" | business-rules/USER_MANAGEMENT_BUSINESS_RULES.md | - |

| "mock API response" | api/examples/README.md | - |

## Important Context Notes

1. **CLAUDE.md in root**: Primary development guidelines (DO NOT MOVE)
2. **Archive folder**: Historical docs for resolved issues (reference only)
3. **Implementation guides**: Show what's already built (avoid rebuilding)
4. **Business rules**: Enforce at database, API, and UI levels

## File Naming Convention

- UPPERCASE.md = Major documentation files
- lowercase.md = Supporting or archive files
- Spaces in filenames = Legacy API docs (e.g., "Softur - API GUIDE.md")

## Documentation Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ Current = Active and up-to-date
- üîÑ In Progress = Being updated
- üì¶ Historical = Archived but preserved
- ‚ùå Deprecated = Outdated, do not use
