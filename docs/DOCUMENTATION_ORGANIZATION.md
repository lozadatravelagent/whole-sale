# Documentation Organization Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Task**: Reorganized all project documentation into a structured `/docs` folder

## What Was Done

### ✅ Created Organized Structure

All `.md` and `.sql` files from the root directory have been organized into a clear folder structure in `/docs`:

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Main documentation index (START HERE)
├── .aicontext                   # AI assistant context guide
├── api/                         # External API integration guides (3 files)
├── architecture/                # System design & performance (3 files)
├── guides/                      # User documentation (3 files)
├── business-rules/              # Business logic & permissions (2 files)
├── implementation/              # Setup & migration guides (4 files)
├── archive/                     # Historical/resolved issues (7 files)
└── sql/                         # SQL scripts (24 files)
    ├── README.md
    ├── migrations/              # One-time migration scripts
    ├── fixes/                   # Historical fix scripts
    └── debug/                   # Debugging queries
```

### 📊 Files Organized

| Category | Files Moved | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **API Documentation** | 3 docs + 6 examples | EUROVIPS/SOFTUR API guides, analysis, and real response examples |
| **Architecture** | 3 | Async search, rate limiting, infrastructure |
| **User Guides** | 3 | PDF templates, search manual, backgrounds |
| **Business Rules** | 2 | User management, role hierarchy |
| **Implementation** | 4 | Setup summaries, n8n workflows, testing |
| **Archive** | 7 | Resolved issues (SUPERADMIN problems, etc.) |
| **SQL Scripts** | 24 | Migrations, fixes, debug queries |
| **PDF Templates** | 3 | HTML templates for PDFMonkey (flights-simple, flights-multiple, combined) |
| **Total** | **55** | All documentation, examples, and templates organized |

### 🗂️ Root Directory Cleanup

**Kept in root** (intentionally):
- `CLAUDE.md` - Primary AI assistant instructions (MUST stay in root)
- `README.md` - Project setup guide (standard location)

**Removed from root** (moved to organized folders):
- 20 `.md` files → Organized into `/docs` category folders
- 23 `.sql` files → Organized into `/docs/sql/{migrations,fixes,debug}`
- 6 `.json` example files → Organized into `/docs/api/examples/flight-responses`
- 3 `.html` PDF templates → Organized into `/src/templates/pdf`

### 📝 Documentation Created

New documentation files to help navigate:

1. **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** - Complete documentation index with:
   - Category descriptions and when to use each
   - Quick reference map for common tasks
   - AI assistant context loading guide
   - Documentation status table

2. **[docs/.aicontext](docs/.aicontext)** - AI assistant guide:
   - Context loading strategy by topic
   - Quick reference map
   - File naming conventions

3. **[docs/archive/README.md](docs/archive/README.md)** - Archive explanation:
   - Why files are archived
   - What problems were resolved
   - When to reference vs. when not to

4. **[docs/sql/README.md](docs/sql/README.md)** - SQL scripts guide:
   - Migration vs. fix vs. debug scripts
   - Usage instructions
   - Best practices

5. **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Updated with:
   - Link to documentation structure
   - Quick reference to key docs
   - Clear navigation guide

## How to Use the New Structure

### For Developers

**Starting a new task?**
1. Read [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) to understand available documentation
2. Find your task in the "Quick Reference Map"
3. Load the relevant documentation files

**Working on user management?**
- Primary: [docs/business-rules/USER_MANAGEMENT_BUSINESS_RULES.md](docs/business-rules/USER_MANAGEMENT_BUSINESS_RULES.md)
- Secondary: [docs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](docs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

**Working on search/API?**
- Primary: [docs/api/Softur - API GUIDE.md](docs/api/Softur%20-%20API%20GUIDE.md)
- Secondary: [docs/architecture/ASYNC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md](docs/architecture/ASYNC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md)

**Working on PDFs?**
- Primary: [docs/guides/CUSTOM_PDF_TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md](docs/guides/CUSTOM_PDF_TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md)
- Secondary: [docs/guides/BACKGROUND_IMAGE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md](docs/guides/BACKGROUND_IMAGE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md)

### For AI Assistants (Claude Code, Cursor)

**When asked about a topic:**
1. Check [docs/.aicontext](docs/.aicontext) for context loading strategy
2. Load the relevant files from the Quick Reference Map
3. Use [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) to understand file relationships

**Example**: User asks "How do user roles work?"
- Load: `docs/business-rules/USER_MANAGEMENT_BUSINESS_RULES.md`
- Reference: `docs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Understand: Role hierarchy is OWNER > SUPERADMIN > ADMIN > SELLER

## Benefits of This Organization

### ✅ For Developers
- **Clear structure**: Easy to find relevant documentation
- **Categorized**: Related docs grouped together
- **Indexed**: Main README provides navigation
- **Cleaned root**: Only essential files in root directory

### ✅ For AI Assistants
- **Context loading**: Clear strategy for which docs to load
- **Quick reference**: Maps topics to documentation files
- **Avoids confusion**: Archive clearly marked as historical
- **Better responses**: Can find relevant context faster

### ✅ For Team
- **Onboarding**: New devs can navigate docs easily
- **Knowledge base**: All info organized and searchable
- **History preserved**: Archive maintains context
- **Maintenance**: Easy to add/update documentation

## Migration Notes

### No Code Changes Required
- ✅ All changes are documentation-only
- ✅ No source code affected
- ✅ No database migrations needed
- ✅ No deployment required

### Git Status
This reorganization moves files, which Git tracks as:
- Deletions from root (old locations)
- Additions to docs/ (new locations)

Git will show this as file renames if committed properly.

### Recommended Commit Message
```
